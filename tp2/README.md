## Project Notes

In this project, we built a room shaped with a floor, 3 simple walls and one complex wall with an opening for a door and a window. The room also has 3 tables with different orientations and sizes, 2 chairs, one beeing on the floor giving the impression that it fell, a lamp coloured in blue and the base in beige.

At first, our main difficulty was applying the materials correctly. Then, finding a good lighting disposition to make the room more appealing by hiding the vertices exposed on the complex wall.

## Project Notes

In this project, we built a NBA court with giant screens, chairs for the fans and players, 2 NBA baskets each with a sponsor, 1 ball on the court and 2 baskets to store the balls. 

Our main difficulty was finding the perfect combination between the lights and materials to give the scene the best look possible.

## Project Notes

In this project, we built a racing game, designed our own car,implemented a menu with various options: start, demo, difficulty, track.
2 tracks were created to have some variety, PowerUps and Obstacles were added to the game such as losing or gaining time, more speed or increased difficulty controlling the car. We also have a Demo option displaying the car's route around the track he's in.
